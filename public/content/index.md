### Questions?

**What is the difference between "display" and "rewarded" ad types?**

_A display ad can only be shown 45 seconds after the one before and should be used in scenarios like when a user dies, or starting a new level. Whereas, rewarded should be used when activated by the user for an extra life or unlocking a skin via advertisement._
